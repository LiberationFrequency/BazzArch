Install and use:

To use ExpoChirpToolbox, you must have Pd-extended installed (http://puredata.info). Copy directory ExpoChirpToolbox to a convenient location on your computer. Patches and binary builds of class [expochirp~] are inside. Leave the directory structure intact. Open Pd-extended and click 'File >> Open', select ExpoChirpToolbox.pd. From there, all associated tools can be accessed.

Special note for Linux 64 bit systems: the executable 'expochirp.pd_linux' in directory 'bin64' must be copied to directory 'tools'. It has the same name as the 32 bit executable, which will be overwritten in the action.
