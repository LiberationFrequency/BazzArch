	win32.
	* Replace all remove functions in tests for temp files (Does not work
	under win32)
	* If FLAC is not supported, set flacread and flacwrite functions to None
	and catch exceptions related to unavailable FLAC support to avoid tests
	failing.
	* Replace non FLAC tests using FLAC files to WAV files.

pyaudiolab (0.6.6dev) Mon, 05 Feb 2007 20:37:49 +0900

	* Add reader/writer factory to matlab-like API. 
	* Generate au/wav/aiff/sdif/flac read/write functions
	with Matlab-like behaviour.
	* disable seek support for FLAC files by default, because of problems
	when using sf_seek(offset, SEEK_SET) with some FLAC versions.

pyaudiolab (0.6.6dev) Mon, 05 Feb 2007 12:06:10 +0900

	* Change system to detect sndfile shared library file (based on
	sys.plaform instead of so_ext which does not seem to work on darwin at
	least).

	* bump to 0.6.5
	* Add mechanism to automatic release+upload
	* release 0.6.5

pyaudiolab (0.6.5dev) Fri, 02 Feb 2007 14:53:01 +0900

	opening a file for writing.
	* Give more meaningful error messages when trying to read a file opened
	only for writing.

pyaudio (0.4) Mon, 06 Nov 2006 12:56:55 +0900

	* Bump to 0.4
	* replace c_longlong with c_int64; if ctypes does not support 64 bits
	integer, it will result in an import error instead of having c_longlong
	silently converted to 32 bits integer, which would result in difficult
	to trace bugs
	* add support for raw files (which requires a format, even for reading)

pyaudio (0.3.1) Mon, 06 Nov 2006 12:56:55 +0900
