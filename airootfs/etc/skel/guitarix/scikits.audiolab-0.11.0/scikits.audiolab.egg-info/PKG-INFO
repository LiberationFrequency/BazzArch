Description: Audiolab is a python package for audio file IO using numpy arrays. It supports
        many different audio formats, including wav, aiff, au, flac, ogg, htk. It also
        supports output to audio device (Mac OS X and Linux only).
        
        For simplicity, a matlab-like API is provided for simple import/export; a more
        complete API is also available.
        
        Audiolab is essentially a wrapper around Erik de Castro Lopo's excellent
        libsndfile:
