audiolab 0.10 2008-12-14
------------------------

Audiolab 0.10 has seen a relatively big internal code change (from ctypes to
cython). It should be faster and more reliable, especially against various
sndfile versions. 

  NEW FEATURES:
   
   * CoreAudio backend for play function: this means mac ox X users can now
     output numpy array data directly on their output device

   * Sndfile and Format class: both sndfile and formatinfo are obsoleted by
     those classes. They are more complient with python conventions, and should
     be easier to use. The old sndfile and formatinfo are still available for
     convenience, but they are thin wrappers around Sndfile and Format classes.
     You are advised to switch.

   * available_file_formats and available_encodings: those functions can be
     used to query the supported file formats and encodings. The old functions
     were fundamentally broken and never worked: those should work whatever
     sndfile version you are using.

   * New formats supported by the dev version of sndfile (1.0.18) are supported
     if built against those recent versions: ogg in particular, is fully
     supported, both through the Sndfile class and the matlab API (oggread and
     oggwrite)
